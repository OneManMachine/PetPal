Introduction:
The pet app, also known as PetPal, that I have created is an app that is a virtual pet
simulation created to provide users with an interactive and entertaining experience.
Users can care for a virtual cat named CHAI by monitoring its hunger, cleanliness, and
happiness levels and performing actions like feeding, playing, and cleaning. The app
aims to offer users a fun and engaging way to take care for a virtual pet on a user’s
device, mimicking the original Tamagotchi pet toy.


Design Considerations:
The design of the PetPal app focuses on simplicity, user interaction, and visual appeal.
The welcome page showcases the app name, a brief pet introduction, and an image for
users to engage with. The second screen displays the user interface. It has a vibrant
layout that’s appealing to the user, with buttons for easy gameplay. The use of animated
GIFs adds liveliness to the app, enhancing the user experience. There are three distinct
buttons, each linked to a different action that influences the pet’s levels. The three text
Views display the hunger, happiness and cleanliness. The goal is for the user to use the
buttons strategically to maintain "CHAI" levels. The background image that was used in
the welcome screen and the gameplay screen are from Canva (Canva, 2024) which
relates to the pet and environmental theme that was further edited to suit the app.


Error Handling:
In PetPal, encountering errors is quite rare due to error handling. However, there are
scenarios. For instance, when a user interacts with one of the three action buttons, if
their pet's hunger, happiness, or cleanliness levels reach their maximum or minimum, a
Toast message will alert them and guides users accordingly.


GitHub:
GitHub Actions were used for automated testing in the PetPal app development process.
By automating testing GitHub Actions, it helped ensure the code quality and reliability
was on point, enabling me to identify and address issues early in the development.
GitHub actions simplified the process, ensuring compatibility with any Android device.
Continuous updates were done by pushing the app to GitHub, ensuring that any edits or
additions made on Android Studio were promptly reflected on the platform.


Automated Testing:
The app underwent testing to guarantee that PetPal will run across all Android devices
and ensure its reliability with no major bugs detected. GitHub Actions was used for this
process, making it straightforward and efficient. Each test cycle took only a few minutes
to complete. Once the test was complete a green tick indicating the app is clear of any
significant errors. This thorough testing consistently done with every code alteration
and update to ensure reliability.
